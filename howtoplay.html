       <h4>Here's a short and simple guide on how to play the game.</h4>
       <hr class="solid">
       <p>
        Once we have all the requirements for this game, we can now proceed to play. Here's how to play
       </p>
       <ul class="indent">
           <li>The deck will consist of 5 Kings, 5 Queens, 5 Aces, and 2 Jokers.</li>
           <li>Before the deck is distributed - the table will be given the main card to discard. Sample: King's Table will require players to discard Kings if they have it.</li>
           <li>Each player will be given 5 cards once the table is decided.</li>
           <li>A player is eliminated in a Russian Roulette fashion where they will pick a paper / card and it will determine whether they are eliminated or not.</li>
           <li>One out of 6 cards/papers will say Eliminated.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
           The goal of the game is to eliminate all other players by bluffing or calling out their lie. As there are a limited number of cards, you can predict your opponent's lie if you have the cards for the type of table.
