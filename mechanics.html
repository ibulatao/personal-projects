       <p>
           The mechanics of the game is simple. It's a game that uses wits, bluffs and deception.
           Here are the things needed for us to play the game:
       </p>
       <ul class="indent">
           <li>2-4 people</li>
           <li>Two decks of playing cards or a virtual machine that has the game</li>
           <li>Stakes that are decided by the players or the standard one in the game</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
           As soon as you have all of these things readily available, you can now get started with setting up the game.
